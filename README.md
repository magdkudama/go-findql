# go-findql

A "find" command on steroids. Created in an *1h 12m*!

## Why?

I don't even know. Sometimes I like to challenge myself to doing things like this. I love "find", but sometimes I find it difficult to remember all the options and parameters. So I wanted to create something simpler ("find" is still better...)

I'm not currently working on Go, so wanted to try out modules and all that stuff. And wanted to do it quick. I no longer have the time to code for fun.

So, I decided to create this library, and wanted a maximum time spent of an hour and a half. So I'm writing this README, trying to fill the remainder of my time.

## Is it production ready?

No. And it's slow, for sure.

## Usage

```bash
$ go-findql -path=vendor -depth=3 -filter="directory=false and size > 600 and name like 'err%' and modified_at > '2019-01-01 00:00:00'"
```

The SQL you write can filter on the following fields (these are the DB columns):

```
name TEXT
size INT
path TEXT
depth INT
regular BOOLEAN
directory BOOLEAN
uid INT
gid INT
user_name TEXT
group_name TEXT
permission_owner TEXT
permission_group TEXT
permission_other TEXT
accessed_at DATETIME
created_at DATETIME
modified_at DATETIME
```

## How did you do it?

Using `sqlite` (in memory), and that's about it.

## Does it work on Windows?

I thought of creating build tags for different platforms... But no. Who uses Windows? ðŸ˜„.

Enjoy!
